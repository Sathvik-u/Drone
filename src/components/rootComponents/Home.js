<b>A modular drone</b> is a special kind of drone that can be changed easily. It's like building with blocks â€“ you can add or remove different parts. <br/> This lets you customize the drone for different tasks.<br/> You can attach different cameras, sensors, or even arms to make the drone do different things.<br/> It's useful because you don't have to buy a whole new drone each time you want to do something different.<br/> People like photographers, filmmakers, and scientists use modular drones because they can change them to suit their needs.<br/> It's also a good way for hobbyists to learn and try out new things with drones.<br/> Overall, modular drones give you the freedom to customize and upgrade the drone to do what you want it to do.</p></div>
